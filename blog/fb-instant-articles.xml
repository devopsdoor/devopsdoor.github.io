  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  # Define ingress and egress rules as needed
  # Example:
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define security groups for other tiers (app, database) similarly
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="launch-ec2-instances-web-tier">Launch EC2 Instances (Web Tier)</h3>

<p>Create EC2 instances for each tier. Append below lines to your code:</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Modify the ami “ami-0287a05f0ef0e9d9a” with your desired ami.</em></p>

  ami           = "ami-0287a05f0ef0e9d9a"  # Specify your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_sg.id]

  # Add user data to install Nginx and serve a sample page
  user_data = &lt;&lt;-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              yum update -y
              yum install nginx -y
              echo "&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my web server!&lt;/h1&gt;" &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
              service nginx start
              EOF
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="set-up-load-balancers">Set Up Load Balancers</h3>

  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.public_subnet.id]

  enable_deletion_protection = false

  # Add listeners, target groups, and other configurations as needed
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p><strong>VPC:</strong> Defines the Virtual Private Cloud network with a specified CIDR block.</p>

<p><strong>Subnets:</strong> Creates public and private subnets within the VPC across different availability zones.</p>

<p><strong>Security Groups:</strong> Defines rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for different tiers (e.g., web, app, database).</p>

<p><strong>EC2 Instances:</strong> Launches an EC2 instance for the web tier, installs Nginx, and serves a sample webpage.</p>

<p><strong>Load Balancers:</strong> Sets up a load balancer to distribute traffic among EC2 instances.</p>

<p>By following these steps and running Terraform, you’ll create a multi-tier infrastructure on AWS, complete with VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and a load balancer, ready to serve a sample web page using Nginx.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-define-variables-optional">Step 5: Define Variables (Optional)</h2>
